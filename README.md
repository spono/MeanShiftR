The package allows individual tree crown delineation (ITCD) from airborne laser scanning point clouds (lidar) using the Adaptive Mean Shift 3D (AMS3D) clustering algorithm described by Ferraz et al. (2016). It 	further	contains functions for parallelization of the clustering and post-processing such as fitting polygons around tree crowns and matching detected crowns with stem positions on the ground.
